# blockrush
a python game by ME :^) i worked quite hard, it's inspired by another game that i lost the github link to

it is called blockrush. you use all 4 arrow keys to move, you can only move one space at a time. avoid the red blocks and you'll be good. the game gradually gets faster (and, therefore, harder) as your speed increases.

# to play on windows:
there are multiple methods for windows play
1. launch blockrush.exe. 
2. right click the blockrush.py file, go to "open with...", and then click "open with program on this pc." now, you navigate to the blockrush directory and click on pyg.exe!
3. launch blockrush.bat.
# to play on linux and mac os:
there are multiple methods for linux and mac os play
1. open blockrush.exe through wine
2. install python (3) and pygame through whichever methods you know best (i.e., through the terminal, through an app manager, etc.). then, through your terminal, navigate to blockrush by doing "cd ~/blockrush" (assuming it's in your home folder). now, enter the command "python blockrush.py" and it will run!
